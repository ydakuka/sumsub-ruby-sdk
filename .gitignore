# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files
# for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

*.gem
*.rbc

/.bundle/
/.yardoc
/_yardoc/
/coverage/
/doc/
/pkg/
/spec/reports/
/tmp/

# rspec failure tracking
.rspec_status

# Other
test_script

# Environment normalization:
/.bundle/
/vendor/bundle/*
!/vendor/bundle/.keep

# For a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
/.ruby-version
/.ruby-gemset

# Unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
/.rvmrc
